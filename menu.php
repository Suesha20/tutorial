<p>START FAST. Get buildings organized, soldiers and or gatherers in place, basically get as much done as possible in the first three minutes of the game. In war- based games,
 you will want to get a recon team or aircraft to scope out enemy positions, and see what kind of army they are preparing, so you can counterattack with the perfect units. Say they
 have light tanks, then you
 get Anti-Tank and heavy tank units. In resource gathering scenarios, start building your army while gathering resources.This will speed up your Army-building process
 dramatically.</p>

<p>Game of the Year (abbreviated GotY) is a title awarded by various gaming publications to a deserving game. Many publications award a single "Game of the Year" to a single 
title that they feel represents the pinnacle of gaming achievement that year. Many games will release a 
"Game of the Year" edition after winning any of these awards, usually containing all the updates, downloadable content (DLC) and occasionally other extras such as a soundtrack.

In an action game, the player typically controls the avatar of a protagonist. The avatar must navigate a level, collecting objects,
 avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with various attacks. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a large boss enemy 
 that is larger and more challenging than other enemies. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the avatar's health and lives, and the game is over when the
 player runs out of lives. Alternatively, the player wins the game by finishing a sequence of levels. But some action games,
 usually arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels; and the player's only goal is to maximize their score by
 collecting objects and defeating enemies.
